when we twist a knob the motors position changes which is a very fascinating result. We worked very hard on this project with endless dedication so our project would turn out this amazing. It is the most amazing creation since Ethan and Ben created the microbit project which was the best project in the class, school, town, county, state, region, country, continent, planet, solar system, galaxy, universe, multiverse, and omniverse. Some critics even view this project by Rowan and Ben better than the old one, which is an outstanding honor. Our project works because the code reads the value from the knob and outputs it to the motor.
